This is a password manager to show off my skill at Javascript. It consists out of two screens, which can be changed by pressing the orange button with a arrow on it. 

The first screen allows you to input a username and password. You have to input both, otherwise you will receive an error message. Once you have wrote down both names, press the “Add User” button.

On the second screen, you can view the information of each user. If you press on the show button, you can see a password of that specific user. If you press on the show all button, you can see the password of every user. Pressing delete removes that specific user.
