# Schoolwerk-Front-End
This is a basic digital portfolio containing a variety of front end assignments I made as part of my software developer MBO 4 course. I hope it allows you to properly demonstrate my programming skill. 
While I did some back end assignments as well, none of them really sufficed for this portfolio. If you want a example of my skill with PHP and SQL, feel free to ask for more information.
